# Fluttering to Efficiency: Embracing Multiplatform Magic and Power tools!

## Intro
This is an intro to how i think flutter can be a superpwer for actually making finished apps.
We'll go through a quick intro to flutter then present the tooling that i think make it a superpower.
Then we'll check out some quick code.
After this some honorable mentions in the flutter system.
And then we'll hopefully test the finished product.

All and all 260 lines of code for an app that:
* Works on IOS WEB ANDROID and pc
* Has theming with Light and dark mode
* Has authentication
* Has a realtime chat
* Has real time updates
